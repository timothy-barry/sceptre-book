## Part II: Methods and Algorithms

This part of the book discusses the methods and algorithms that undergird `sceptre`. It also explores several theoretical issues related to the conditions under which these methods can be expected to work well in practice.

-   @sec-methods_overview provides an overview of the statistical methods that underlie `sceptre`.

-   @sec-accelerations describes the various statistical and computational accelerations that help make `sceptre` fast.

-   @sec-theory explores several theoretical issues, including the precise conditions under which differential expression testing methods --- including `sceptre`, negative binomial regression, and the Wilcoxon test --- can be expected to control the rate of false positives on a single-cell CRISPR screen dataset.

-   @sec-experimental_design provides recommendations on experimental design for single-cell CRISPR screens.
