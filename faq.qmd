# Frequently asked questions {#sec-faq}

##  I am trying to install `sceptre` but am getting an error. What should I do?

The first thing to do is to remove any previous installations of `sceptre` and then try again. First, determine the directory on your computer in which R packages are stored by executing `.libPaths()` in the R console.

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

Next, within your terminal, `cd` to this directory and then execute `rm -rf sceptre`.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library # change me!
rm -rf sceptre
```

Now, try to install `sceptre` again.

If this does not work, try to delete and reinstall the dependencies of `sceptre`. `sceptre` has the following dependencies: `BH`, `cowplot`, `crayon`, `data.table`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `Matrix`, `Rcpp`. Using the method described above, delete and reinstall each of these dependencies one-by-one.

##  My negative control p-values are miscalibrated. What should I do?

Not to worry! First of all, the extent of the miscalibration may be mild enough not to cause significant issues with your analysis; see @tbl-calibration_quality for assessing the severity of your miscalibration. If the miscalibration is moderate to severe, then see @sec-improving_calibration for several helpful suggestions to improve your calibration.
